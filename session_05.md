# Demystifying Terms Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence
## Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to learn, think, and perform tasks, especially computer systems. AI uses technologies like machine learning and neural networks to analyze data, make decisions, and more. 
Types of AI
1) Machine learning: A subset of AI that uses algorithms to learn from data and improve over time 
2) Deep learning: A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to make predictions 
3) Generative AI: A type of AI that can create new content like text, images, or videos based on user prompts 
4) Natural language processing: A type of AI that enables computers to understand and use human language 
## Artificial General Intelligence
Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a hypothetical machine intelligence that can learn and perform any intellectual task a human can. AGI is also known as strong AI or deep AI. 
How AGI might work
1) Learn human behavior: AGI can learn human behavior and understand consciousness. 
2) Transfer knowledge: AGI can transfer knowledge and skills learned in one domain to another. 
3) Common sense: AGI has a vast knowledge of the world, including facts, relationships, and social norms. 
4) Social and emotional engagement: AGI can recognize and understand emotions, including facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice.
   
Potential uses of AGI 

1) Assisting healthcare workers
2) Making recommendations for movies, music, and books
3) Contributing to the development of new products and industries
4) Increasing the abundance of resources
5) Turbocharging the global economy
6) Discovering new scientific knowledge
