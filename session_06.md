# Python Data Types
## Numeric Type
Numeric data types represent numbers, and there are three main types of numbers:
1. int (Integer)
2. float (Floating Point Number)
3. complex (Complex Number)
### Integer
1. int (Integer)
An integer is a whole number that can be either positive, negative, or zero. It does not have any decimal or fractional parts. Examples of integers include:
- Positive integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
- Negative integers: -1, -2, -3, -4, ...
- Zero: 0

### Float
A data type that have a decimal point.
It's commonly used to store real numbers, meaning numbers that can have fractional parts. The float type can represent both very large and very small numbers, with varying degrees of precision, depending on the system and programming language.

### Complex
a complex data type is used to represent numbers that have both a real part and an imaginary part. Complex numbers are often used in fields like mathematics, engineering, physics, and signal processing.

Python: Python has built-in support for complex numbers. You can represent a complex number using a + bj, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part.

## Text Type
### String
In Python, the text type refers to strings, which are sequences of characters. Strings are one of the built-in data types used to represent textual data. In Python, strings are defined using either single quotes (') or double quotes (")

## Sequence Type
### List
List is a collection of elements grouped together

### Tuple
TUPLES  are similiar to list  but are immutatble, meaning once you create a tuple, you cannot change, add, or remove items.

### Range
In Python, range() is a built-in function used to generate a sequence of numbers, which can be used in loops or other contexts that require an iterable. The range() function takes up to three arguments:

1) start (optional): The value to start the sequence (default is 0).
2) stop: The value where the sequence will stop, but it is not included in the sequence.
3) step (optional): The difference between each number in the sequence (default is 1).

## Mapping Type
A mapping type refers to a collection type that associates keys with values. The most commonly used mapping type in Python is the dict (dictionary).
 
### Dictionary
A dictionary is a built-in data type that stores data in key-value pairs. Dictionaries are unordered, changeable, and indexed by keys.

## Set Type
A set is an unordered collection data type that is mutable, iterable, and does not allow duplicate elements. Sets are commonly used to store unique items and perform operations like unions, intersections, and differences between collections.
 
## Boolean
true or False

## None Type
The none type represents the absence of a value or a null value

# Operators in Python
## Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc., on numbers.
### Addition
Adds two numbers.
### Subtraction
Subtracts the second number from the first.
### Multiplication
Multiplies two numbers.
### Division
Divides the first number by the second, and always returns a float.

### Modulous
Returns the remainder of the division of two numbers.
### Exponent
Raises the first number to the power of the second.
### Floor Division
Divides the first number by the second and returns the integer part of the result (rounds down to the nearest whole number).

## Assignment Operator
The assignment operator is used to assign values to variables.

## Comparison Operator
- >
  The > operator checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.

- <
  The < operator checks if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.

- >=
  The >= operator checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right.

- <=
  The <= operator checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right.

- ==
  The == operator checks if the values on both sides are equal.

## Logical Operators
 logical operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean values (or expressions). These operators return True or False based on the conditions provided. The logical operators in Python are and, or, and not.
 
### AND
The and operator returns True if both operands are True. If either of the operands is False, the result will be False.
and: Returns True if both operands are True. Otherwise, False.

### OR
The or operator returns True if at least one of the operands is True. If both operands are False, the result will be False.
or: Returns True if at least one operand is True. Otherwise, False.

### NOT
The not operator is a unary operator that reverses the logical state of its operand. It returns True if the operand is False, and False if the operand is True.
not: Reverses the truth value of the operand. It returns True if the operand is False, and False if the operand is True.

## Membership Operator
In Python, the membership operators in and not in are used to check if a value exists within an iterable (such as a list, tuple, string, etc.).

### IN
The in operator checks if a value is present in an iterable (e.g., list, tuple, string).
in: Returns True if the element is present in the iterable, False otherwise.

### NOT IN
The not in operator checks if a value is not present in an iterable.
not in: Returns True if the element is not present in the iterable, False otherwise.

## Identity Operator
In Python, the identity operators is and is not are used to compare the memory locations of two objects, checking whether they refer to the same object in memory or not.

### is
The is operator checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory.
is: Returns True if both variables refer to the same object in memory, otherwise returns False.

### is not
The is not operator checks if two variables do not refer to the same object in memory.
is not: Returns True if both variables do not refer to the same object in memory, otherwise returns False.
