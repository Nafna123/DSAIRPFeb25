# Python Data Types
## Numeric Type
### Integer
An integer is a whole number that can be either positive, negative, or zero. It does not have any decimal or fractional parts. Examples of integers include:

Positive integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
Negative integers: -1, -2, -3, -4, ...
Zero: 0

### Float
A data type that have a decimal point.
It's commonly used to store real numbers, meaning numbers that can have fractional parts. The float type can represent both very large and very small numbers, with varying degrees of precision, depending on the system and programming language.

### Complex
a complex data type is used to represent numbers that have both a real part and an imaginary part. Complex numbers are often used in fields like mathematics, engineering, physics, and signal processing.

Python: Python has built-in support for complex numbers. You can represent a complex number using a + bj, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part.

## Text Type


### String
In Python, the text type refers to strings, which are sequences of characters. Strings are one of the built-in data types used to represent textual data. In Python, strings are defined using either single quotes (') or double quotes (")

## Sequence Type
### List
List is a collection of elements grouped together

### Tuple
TUPLES  are similiar to list  but are immutatble, meaning once you create a tuple, you cannot change, add, or remove items.

### Range

## Mapping Type
### Dictionary

## Set Type

## Boolean
true or False

## None Type
The none type represents the absence of a value or a null value
