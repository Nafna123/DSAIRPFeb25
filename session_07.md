# Control Flow
## IF
This checks a condition, and if its true, the indented code block under it will be executed

## IF-ELSE
None, False, 0 areinterpreted as False. All others are equivalent to True in  if-else condition

## IF-ELIF-ELSE
This captures any remaining  cases that dont match the if or elif conditions. It executes if all previous conditions are false.

## Nested IFs
you can also nest conditional statements for more complex checks

# Loops
In Python, loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. 

## For Loop
The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range). It repeats a block of code for each item in the sequence.

## While Loop
The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a condition is True.

### Continue
Skips the current iteration and continues with the next iteration.

### Break
Exits the loop prematurely.

# Basic Library Usage
## Keyword library
In Python, keywords are reserved words that have special meaning and functionality within the language. These words cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names, function names, or class names). They are predefined in Python and serve specific purposes.

# Print formatting
In Python, print formatting allows you to control how output is displayed, making it cleaner and more readable. There are several ways to format strings when printing in Python. 

## Placeholder passing
Placeholders are used within string formatting to specify where variables or expressions should be inserted into the string. You can pass values to these placeholders in several ways, depending on the formatting method you're using. The three main formatting methods: old-style string formatting, str.format(), and f-strings.

## Multiline Assignment
Multiline assignment allows you to assign multiple variables on separate lines or even within a single line using a specific syntax. This can be useful when you have multiple variables to assign values to and want to keep your code neat and readable.

## Line-breaking
Line-breaking refers to splitting a long line of code into multiple lines to improve readability, especially when the code becomes too long to fit comfortably within a single line. Python allows line-breaking in several places, including within expressions, function calls, and assignments.
